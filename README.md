# Advanced-Braking-Mechanisms

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on pedestrian detection to enhance vehicle safety. Utilizing the robust and efficient Faster R-CNN framework, model is trained on the comprehensive Caltech Pedestrian Dataset. The primary goal of this project is to create a real-time detection system that can alert drivers when a pedestrian is detected within a predefined Region of Interest (ROI).

## Features

- **Faster R-CNN Model:** Leverages the powerful Faster R-CNN architecture for accurate and real-time pedestrian detection.
- **Caltech Pedestrian Dataset:** Trained on the extensive and diverse Caltech Pedestrian Dataset, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in various scenarios.
- **Driver Alert System:** Integrates a prototype developed in Python that triggers alerts to the vehicle driver when a pedestrian is detected in the ROI.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Designed to operate in real-time, making it suitable for active vehicular environments.
